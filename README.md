# Nagger Bot - Your Personal Productivity Bully

## Why I Built This

My brain has the memory of a goldfish üêü. I forget stuff within minutes, so I built something that literally annoys me until I do the damn task. It‚Äôs less of a to-do list and more like a personal bully that keeps nagging me‚Äîbasically my own toxic productivity buddy.

If you're like me and need constant, relentless reminders to get things done, this bot is for you.

## What It Does

Nagger Bot is a Telegram bot designed to be your personal task manager. It allows you to quickly add tasks, set deadlines, and configure reminders that will keep pinging you until you mark the task as complete.

### Key Features:
- **Quick Add**: Add tasks in a single line with natural language.
- **Customizable Reminders**: Set reminders at any frequency (minutes, hours, or daily).
- **Active Hours**: Configure reminders to only be active during specific hours (e.g., 8 AM - 10 PM).
- **Escalation Mode**: Reminders get more frequent as the deadline approaches.
- **User-Specific IDs**: Your task IDs always start from 1, even in a multi-user environment.
- **Clear Command**: Wipe all your tasks and start fresh.
